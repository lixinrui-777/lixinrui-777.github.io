        <p> Last month, I first attended IELTS examination. Before the day, I have prepared for it over one year. I was extremely nervous because I was afraid that my effort was wasted and did not get good result. When the Speaking test day came, I got up early in the morning. My father drove me to Yangzhou since Nanjing didn’t have place for the examination. I reviewed all the topics I have prepared on the car that morning.After 2 hours driving, I finally arrived the place. I was put in the waiting room, where I met a lot of students my age, some adults, and everyone was very nervous. Finally my turn, the same batch of candidates, I was the last to enter the examination room, because my examiner came a little late. I was so nervous that I couldn’t look the examiner in the eye. Fortunately, my examiner is very kind, step by step guide me, let me find the feeling. When it was over, I was in such a good mood. Two days later, I had another written exam. I have more confidence in the written test than the oral test, because I have done a lot of questions. Fortunately, the test was very easy to listen to and read, so I thought I did a good job. The composition was of a type I had never seen before, but it took me only fifteen minutes to come up with a rough outline, so I did well. Two more weeks passed, and it was time for results. I was really nervous because I wasn’t sure if I was going to make it this time. As soon as 12:00 arrived, I urged the teacher to help me check the score, and to my surprise, I passed! I am so grateful for all the hard work I have done for IELTS, and it has inspired me to work even harder for Living Up!</p>
