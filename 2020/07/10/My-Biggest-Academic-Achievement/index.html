        <p>My Biggest Academic Achievement</p>
<p>In fact, I am not the kind of student who  is good at studying .Because I am poor at concentrating while studying, this leads to disappointing exam results.</p>
<p>.However, an opportunity changed my mindset and led me to my biggest academic achievement.</p>
<p>I still remember the time when I was in seventh grade. My friend and I had planned to take part in a study tour to Britain organized by the school that summer holiday. However, just one month before departure, our teacher told us that the school had made new regulations for it.</p>
<p>Every member in this tour would have to be ranked into first thirty in the final exam. I really felt stressed about it because my position was around 100 out of 300 students .It meant that I needed to  beat 70 people. That would be extremely hard for me but I didnâ€™t want to lose the chance to join the tour.</p>
<p>I began to make a plan of study for the month and listed my weak subjects,which were biology,geography and mathematics. The first two were quite easy to revise but mathematics needed more thinking and practicing. I divided 30 days into four parts.The first three parts were taken up by those three subjects and last part was allocated to the remaining subjects. I also tried to study with my friends who were good at studying.</p>
<p>The plan was perfect but it was difficult to do. I  realized that I couldnot solve all the problems myself, so I asked  my teacher. However, my teachers were all very busy and did not have enough time to answer my question, therefore,I decided to find a teacher outside the school. My parents helped me to find three teachers for subjects above and every lesson,I tried my best to solve as many problems as I could.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, I had to do the mock exam and I felt very confident because I had prepared for it very well. However, when the results came out,I was shocked. I was still the 100th of 300 s tudents.</p>
<p>When I got my results, I simply could not believe that I did such a bad test .This was so far from what I expected that  I nearly cried. Then, my friend came and told me that I should focus on my own mistakes and should stop solving new problems because they were not helpful to me. I then changed my study style. I told my parents to stop the extra lessons and began to review what I have done before. Also, I forced myself to read course books and try to remember every detail. </p>
<p>Finally the day of the exam arrived and I told myself to be calm. After the test,I still felt nervous but fortunately ,the result lived up to my expectations. I was the 9th out of 300 students in that exam and that summer was one of my happiest holidays.</p>
<p>Everyone seems to have unlimited potential. It needs a little power to release and determination is also essential. In addition, goals are very important for students to have which can bring huge changes to our lives.</p>
