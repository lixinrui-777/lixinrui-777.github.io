        <p>This summer vacation, I got an internship in the bank. This is the first time that I have really come into contact with the internal operation system of the bank, so I am very excited. A total of one week internship, eight hours a day, a teacher is responsible for leading me to study.<br>On the first day, under the leadership of the teacher, I learned about the composition of the bank, which was divided into lobby, business department and organ. The lobby is responsible for receiving and solving customer problems, such as handling deposits, funds and financial products. Business department is responsible for dealing with credit card business, often need to go out and negotiate with customers. The agency is responsible for the approval of documents and projects, and does not involve direct communication with customers.<br>For the next few days, I followed my teacher out to visit customers. Through personal experience, we know that the work of the bank is not as easy as imagined, and the problems of customers are different. As employees, we need to have enough patience and professional knowledge to answer their questions at any time. At the same time, we should know the background of customers in advance to ensure that no loss will be caused.<br>In the last two days, I was exposed to the actual business for the first time. Although only responsible for copying, copying and printing, but still full of sense of participation.<br>After this internship, I feel the work is not easy, but also understand the responsibilities of various departments behind the bank, which has benefited me a lot.</p>

        <p> Last month, I first attended IELTS examination. Before the day, I have prepared for it over one year. I was extremely nervous because I was afraid that my effort was wasted and did not get good result. When the Speaking test day came, I got up early in the morning. My father drove me to Yangzhou since Nanjing didn’t have place for the examination. I reviewed all the topics I have prepared on the car that morning.After 2 hours driving, I finally arrived the place. I was put in the waiting room, where I met a lot of students my age, some adults, and everyone was very nervous. Finally my turn, the same batch of candidates, I was the last to enter the examination room, because my examiner came a little late. I was so nervous that I couldn’t look the examiner in the eye. Fortunately, my examiner is very kind, step by step guide me, let me find the feeling. When it was over, I was in such a good mood. Two days later, I had another written exam. I have more confidence in the written test than the oral test, because I have done a lot of questions. Fortunately, the test was very easy to listen to and read, so I thought I did a good job. The composition was of a type I had never seen before, but it took me only fifteen minutes to come up with a rough outline, so I did well. Two more weeks passed, and it was time for results. I was really nervous because I wasn’t sure if I was going to make it this time. As soon as 12:00 arrived, I urged the teacher to help me check the score, and to my surprise, I passed! I am so grateful for all the hard work I have done for IELTS, and it has inspired me to work even harder for Living Up!</p>

        <p>My Biggest Academic Achievement</p>
<p>In fact, I am not the kind of student who  is good at studying .Because I am poor at concentrating while studying, this leads to disappointing exam results.</p>
<p>.However, an opportunity changed my mindset and led me to my biggest academic achievement.</p>
<p>I still remember the time when I was in seventh grade. My friend and I had planned to take part in a study tour to Britain organized by the school that summer holiday. However, just one month before departure, our teacher told us that the school had made new regulations for it.</p>
<p>Every member in this tour would have to be ranked into first thirty in the final exam. I really felt stressed about it because my position was around 100 out of 300 students .It meant that I needed to  beat 70 people. That would be extremely hard for me but I didn’t want to lose the chance to join the tour.</p>
<p>I began to make a plan of study for the month and listed my weak subjects,which were biology,geography and mathematics. The first two were quite easy to revise but mathematics needed more thinking and practicing. I divided 30 days into four parts.The first three parts were taken up by those three subjects and last part was allocated to the remaining subjects. I also tried to study with my friends who were good at studying.</p>
<p>The plan was perfect but it was difficult to do. I  realized that I couldnot solve all the problems myself, so I asked  my teacher. However, my teachers were all very busy and did not have enough time to answer my question, therefore,I decided to find a teacher outside the school. My parents helped me to find three teachers for subjects above and every lesson,I tried my best to solve as many problems as I could.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, I had to do the mock exam and I felt very confident because I had prepared for it very well. However, when the results came out,I was shocked. I was still the 100th of 300 s tudents.</p>
<p>When I got my results, I simply could not believe that I did such a bad test .This was so far from what I expected that  I nearly cried. Then, my friend came and told me that I should focus on my own mistakes and should stop solving new problems because they were not helpful to me. I then changed my study style. I told my parents to stop the extra lessons and began to review what I have done before. Also, I forced myself to read course books and try to remember every detail. </p>
<p>Finally the day of the exam arrived and I told myself to be calm. After the test,I still felt nervous but fortunately ,the result lived up to my expectations. I was the 9th out of 300 students in that exam and that summer was one of my happiest holidays.</p>
<p>Everyone seems to have unlimited potential. It needs a little power to release and determination is also essential. In addition, goals are very important for students to have which can bring huge changes to our lives.</p>

        <p>As a child, I had  never experienced any big disappointments since I never really cared about anything. As a result, I thought that everything was easy and  that continued until 2018 when I was 14 years old.</p>
<p>   I remember that I became crazy about K-pop in 2016. At first, I just enjoyed the dynamic singing and dancing and also those good-looking faces. Later l decided that I wanted to be them. It was the first time I had really wanted to do something. I even asked my parents to find teachers to teach me singing and dancing. During the whole of 2017, I made great progress. I could sing and dance to almost all of K-pop’s famous songs. I also surfed the internet to research information on Korean groups.. At the end of 2017, I successfully signed up for the 2018 talent show in Nanjing. I was so excited and it was like paradise,</p>
<p> However, for political reasons,that talent show was cancelled. I was extremely upset until in 2018 during my dancing lesson,my teacher told me that there was a chance to take part in a private talent show but on a weekday. I felt torn because both my studies and my dream were important to me. Finally ,I decided to have a try. I asked the teacher for leave and hid it from my parents. I had prepared for it for over one year, so the chance was really precious to me.</p>
<p>  When it was my turn, I felt very nervous and almost made mistakes but finally I finished it successfully .Even the staff applauded me .After that ,the staff made me stay behind and told me I had reached the second stage. Only 4 people achieved that . At that moment, I felt extremely happy. However, they told us only one person could be accepted into the company to be a trainer.</p>
<p>  A week later, the staff emailed me to tell me that I had not been successful. It really felt painful since it was the first time I had devoted my heart to anything . I even felt lost for a period of time.</p>
<p>  Now it seems that this failure has also helped me. For example, I have realized the joy of struggle even if the ending was less than satisfactory. Through the process, I had the chance to experience new things. Also, I now understand that not everything can be a success . Although I failed, I still feel thankful and consider this experience to be one of the most important moments in my life.</p>

        <p>Last week,I finished my holiday and went back to school. I was very excited to see my friends. However, bad news came immediately. </p>
<p>Our chemistry teacher told us that we would have a test just on Monday! To be honest, I have forgot lots of knowledge during the holiday, so I was extremely worried.</p>
<p>During the test, I found that many  questions are familiar,but I could not remember the accurate answer. I nearly got mad.</p>
<p>After the test, my friends complained that to me. I was surprised that we had same issues. </p>
<p>Other tests then came continuously, I was very tired of them. From almost every paper, I saw questions I knew,but I cannot get full marks.</p>
<p>It was then that I finally understood the importance of  review and organize knowledge points.</p>
<p>In order to  be able to easily cope with the examination, I decided to make clear plan and went over what I have studied from now on.</p>
