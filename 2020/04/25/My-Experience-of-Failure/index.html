        <p>As a child, I had  never experienced any big disappointments since I never really cared about anything. As a result, I thought that everything was easy and  that continued until 2018 when I was 14 years old.</p>
<p>   I remember that I became crazy about K-pop in 2016. At first, I just enjoyed the dynamic singing and dancing and also those good-looking faces. Later l decided that I wanted to be them. It was the first time I had really wanted to do something. I even asked my parents to find teachers to teach me singing and dancing. During the whole of 2017, I made great progress. I could sing and dance to almost all of K-popâ€™s famous songs. I also surfed the internet to research information on Korean groups.. At the end of 2017, I successfully signed up for the 2018 talent show in Nanjing. I was so excited and it was like paradise,</p>
<p> However, for political reasons,that talent show was cancelled. I was extremely upset until in 2018 during my dancing lesson,my teacher told me that there was a chance to take part in a private talent show but on a weekday. I felt torn because both my studies and my dream were important to me. Finally ,I decided to have a try. I asked the teacher for leave and hid it from my parents. I had prepared for it for over one year, so the chance was really precious to me.</p>
<p>  When it was my turn, I felt very nervous and almost made mistakes but finally I finished it successfully .Even the staff applauded me .After that ,the staff made me stay behind and told me I had reached the second stage. Only 4 people achieved that . At that moment, I felt extremely happy. However, they told us only one person could be accepted into the company to be a trainer.</p>
<p>  A week later, the staff emailed me to tell me that I had not been successful. It really felt painful since it was the first time I had devoted my heart to anything . I even felt lost for a period of time.</p>
<p>  Now it seems that this failure has also helped me. For example, I have realized the joy of struggle even if the ending was less than satisfactory. Through the process, I had the chance to experience new things. Also, I now understand that not everything can be a success . Although I failed, I still feel thankful and consider this experience to be one of the most important moments in my life.</p>
